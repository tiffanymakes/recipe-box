          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>  When buying chickpea flour, know that chickpea flour, garbanzo bean flour, gram flour, and besan are all different names used to describe the same product.  They are dried chickpeas that have been ground into flour.</li>   
            <li>  Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, has a high concentration of sulfur and gives the chickpea flour scramble its egg-like flavor.  If you don’t have any, you can just use sea salt.  </li>
            <li>  For the baby chick eggshell, I used a homemade tapioca pancake, but a tortilla works just as well.  </li>
